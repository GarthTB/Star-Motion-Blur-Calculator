# Star-Motion-Blur-Calculator
This programme uses the optimized NPF rule, which uses the input FWHM instead of the Airy disk as the radius of a star, to calculate the maximum exposure time to take a photo of a starry sky without the stars trailing too much. This rule is far better than the “rule of 500” which gives results that are too assertive and contrary to the facts. It can also be used to calculate the length of a star trail at a specific exposure time.
# 拖线计算器
此程序使用改良的NPF法则——将原始公式中的艾里斑半径换成输入的星点半宽，来计算拍摄星空时，能保证星星不明显拖线的最长曝光时间。此法则远比以前常用的“星空500”法则更精确、更科学。它也能用于计算特定曝光时间下的拖线长度。
